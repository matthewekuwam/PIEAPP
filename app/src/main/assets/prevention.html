<h4>To prevent the spread of COVID-19:</h4>
<p>Clean your hands often. Use soap and water, or an alcohol-based hand rub.</p>
<p>Maintain a safe distance from anyone who is coughing or sneezing.
    Wear a mask when physical distancing is not possible.</p>
<p>Donâ€™t touch your eyes, nose or mouth.</p>
<p>Cover your nose and mouth with your bent elbow or a tissue when you cough or sneeze.</p>
<p>Stay home if you feel unwell.
</p>

<p>If you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention.</p>
<p>Calling in advance allows your healthcare provider to quickly direct you to the right health facility. This protects you, and prevents the spread of viruses and other infections.</p>
<h4>Masks</h4>
<p>Masks can help prevent the spread of the virus from the person wearing the mask to others. Masks alone do not protect against COVID-19, and should be combined with physical distancing and hand hygiene. Follow the advice provided by your local health authority.</p>
